# DatabaseSystemsProject1
BlackBoard Content are the Instructions provided.

Project consisted of creating 20 propositions from simple/medium/complex skewed more towards complex choosing between 3 separate databases to query, then solving those propositions with T-SQL code, required to choose the best and worst 3 querys for simple/medium/complex and re-evaluate how to make the query more efficient. There is a voice annotated power point along with said code however file was too large. 

There was also a JDBC component where we wrote out the Java code to connect to a database and test our Querys and that was done successfully, and there was use of Docker to create temporary connection to create and run propositions off SSMS.

Lastly, there was a project planning aspect as well where we met together on voice call and spoke about what questions we had that needed answering and if anyone was behind in their work we would give them suggestions and encouragement to work on it and the use of a Gantt Planner to document our progress through the project
